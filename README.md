# wakatime-json-viewer
Visualize JSON data exported from WakaTime

## How do I use this?
1. Clone the repository
1. Replace the `data/wakatime.json` file with your [JSON file](#how-to-get-your-JSON). Make sure to rename your JSON file to `wakatime.json` so that the app can find it!
1. Install dependencies (`npm i`/`yarn install`/`pnpm i`/`bun i`)
1. Run the dev script (`npm run dev`/`yarn run dev`/`pnpm run dev`/`bun run dev`)
1. Visit http://localhost:3000 and see your stats!

## How to get your JSON

1. Visit [your settings](https://wakatime.com/settings/account).
1. Under "export", click "Export my coding activity".
1. Choose "Daily totals".
1. After the export finishes, download your JSON file.
